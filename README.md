This repository has the data and code developed for a project assessing github usage in pubmed papers. This work was (mostly) completed during OHBM 2019 hackathon.

The data directory contains a series of csv files that describe basic details of the pubmed papers. These papers can be obtained at the [BioC API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/APIs/BioC-PubMed/). 

Because getting papers from the API takes a while, you can also download a set of fulltext papers from [this googledrive link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QhsJ5lpmOZpZJImwyOlbHRWBYslP3BiD). All of these papers are ones that contain the text string `github`.
